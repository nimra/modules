    "Until recently, software engineers went to school to learn a number of basic algorithms (graph search, sorting, database queries, and so on). After school, these engineers would go out into the real world to apply these algorithms to systems. Most of today’s digital economy is built on intricate chains of basic algorithms laboriously glued together by generations of engineers. Most of these systems are not capable of adapting. All configurations and reconfigurations have to be performed by highly trained engineers, rendering systems brittle."

    "Machine learning promises to change the field of software development by enabling systems to adapt dynamically. Deployed machine learning systems are capable of learning desired behaviors from databases of examples. Furthermore, such systems can be regularly retrained as new data comes in. Very sophisticated software systems, powered by machine learning, are capable of dramatically changing their behavior without major changes to their code (just to their training data). This trend is only likely to accelerate as machine learning tools and deployment become easier and easier."

    "As the behavior of software-engineered systems changes, the roles of software engineers will change as well. In some ways, this transformation will be analogous to the transformation following the development of programming languages. The first computers were painstakingly programmed. Networks of wires were connected and inter‐connected. Then punchcards were set up to enable the creation of new programs without hardware changes to computers. Following the punchcard era, the first assembly languages were created. Then higher-level languages like Fortran or Lisp. Succeeding layers of development have created very high-level languages like Python, with intricate ecosystems of precoded algorithms. Much modern computer science even relies on autogenerated code. Modern app developers use tools like Android Studio to autogenerate much of the code they’d like to make. Each successive wave of simplification has broadened the scope of computer science by lowering barriers to entry."

    "Machine learning promises to lower barriers even further; programmers will soon be able to change the behavior of systems by altering training data, possibly without writing a single line of code. On the user side, systems built on spoken language and natural language understanding such as Alexa and Siri will allow nonprogrammers to perform complex computations. Furthermore, ML powered systems are likely to become more robust against errors. The capacity to retrain models will mean that codebases can shrink and that maintainability will increase. In short, machine learning is likely to completely upend the role of software engineers. Today’s programmers will need to understand how machine learning systems learn, and will need to understand the classes of errors that arise in common machine learning systems. Furthermore, they will need to understand the design patterns that underlie machine learning systems (very different in style and form from classical software design patterns). And, they will need to know enough tensor calculus to understand why a sophisticated deep architecture may be misbehaving during learning. It’s not an understatement to say that understanding machine learning (theory and practice) will become a fundamental skill that every computer scientist and software engineer will need to understand for the coming decade."
