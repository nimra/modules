    "Deep learning has revolutionized the technology industry. Modern machine translation, search engines, and computer assistants are all powered by deep learning. This trend will only continue as deep learning expands its reach into robotics, pharmaceuticals, energy, and all other fields of contemporary technology. It is rapidly becoming essential for the modern software professional to develop a working knowledge of the principles of deep learning."

    "In this chapter, we will introduce you to the history of deep learning, and to the broader impact deep learning has had on the research and commercial communities. We will next cover some of the most famous applications of deep learning. This will include both prominent machine learning architectures and fundamental deep learning primitives. We will end by giving a brief perspective of where deep learning is heading over the next few years before we dive into TensorFlow in the next few chapters."
