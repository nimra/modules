    "In this chapter, we covered the basics of hyperparameter optimization, the process of selecting values for model parameters that canâ€™t be learned automatically on the training data. In particular, we introduced random and grid hyperparameter search and demonstrated the use of such code for optimizing models on the Tox21 dataset introduced in the last chapter."
