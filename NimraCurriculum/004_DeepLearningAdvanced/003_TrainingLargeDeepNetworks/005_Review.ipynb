    "In this chapter, you learned about various types of hardware commonly used to train deep architectures. You also learned about data parallel and model parallel designs for training deep architectures on multiple CPUs or GPUs. We ended the chapter by walking through a case study on how to implement data parallel training of convolutional networks in TensorFlow."
