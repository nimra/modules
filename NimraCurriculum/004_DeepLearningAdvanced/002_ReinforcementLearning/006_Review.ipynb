    "In this chapter, we introduced you to the core concepts of reinforcement learning (RL). We walked you through some recent successes of RL methods on ATARI, upside-down helicopter flight, and computer Go. We then taught you about the mathematical framework of Markov decision processes. We brought it together with a detailed case study walking you through the construction of a tic-tac-toe agent. This algorithm uses a sophisticated training method, A3C, that makes use of multiple CPU cores to speed up training. In Chapter 9, youâ€™ll learn more about training models with multiple GPUs."
