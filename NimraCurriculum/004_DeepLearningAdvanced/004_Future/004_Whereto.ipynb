    "However, machine learning is a very rapidly evolving field. The explosive growth of the field has meant that dozens of worthwhile new models are discovered each year. Practicing machine learners should constantly remain on the lookout for new models. When looking at new models, a helpful trick for evaluating their usefulness is to try to think about how you can apply the model to problems you or your organization cares about. This test provides a good way to organize the large influx of models from the research community, and will give you a tool to prioritize your learning on the techniques that really matter to you."

    "As a responsible machine learner, make sure to think about what your data science models are being used for. Ask yourself whether your work on machine learning is being used to improve human welfare. If the answer is no, then realize that with your skills, you have the ability to find a job where you can use your machine learning superpowers for good, not evil."
