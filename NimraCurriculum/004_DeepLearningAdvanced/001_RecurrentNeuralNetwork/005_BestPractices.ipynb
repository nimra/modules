    "In this section, you will learn about the use of recurrent neural networks for language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset, a natural language dataset built from Wall Street Journal articles. We will introduce the TensorFlow primitives needed to perform this modeling and will also walk you through the data handling and preprocessing steps needed to prepare data for training. We encourage you to follow along and try running the code in the GitHub repo associated with the book."
