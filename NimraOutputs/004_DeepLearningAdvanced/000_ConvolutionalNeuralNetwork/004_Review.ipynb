    "In this chapter, we have shown you the basic concepts of convolutional network design. These concepts include convolutional and pooling layers that constitute core building blocks of convolutional networks. We then discussed applications of convolutional architectures such as object detection, image segmentation, and image generation. We ended the chapter with an in-depth case study that showed you how to train a convolutional architecture on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.\n",

    "In Chapter 7, we will cover recurrent neural networks, another core deep learning architecture. Unlike convolutional networks, which were designed for image processing, recurrent architectures are powerfully suited to handling sequential data such as natural language datasets."
