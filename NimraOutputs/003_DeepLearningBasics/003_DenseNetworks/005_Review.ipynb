    "In this chapter, we’ve introduced you to fully connected deep networks. We delved into the mathematical theory of these networks, and explored the concept of “universal approximation,” which partially explains the learning power of fully connected networks. We ended with a case study, where you trained a deep fully connected architecture on the Tox21 dataset.\n",

    "In this chapter, we haven’t yet shown you how to tune the fully connected network to achieve good predictive performance. In Chapter 5, we will discuss “hyperparameter optimization,” the process of tuning network parameters, and have you tune the parameters of the Tox21 network introduced in this chapter."
